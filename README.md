# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance System project! This application aims to streamline attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. This project is developed as part of Technical University's emphasizing the integration of frontend, backend, and database technologies.

## Problem Statement

**Problem:** Traditional attendance systems are often cumbersome, time-consuming, and prone to inaccuracies. The goal is to create an efficient and secure attendance tracking system using facial recognition.

**Impact:** Manual attendance tracking can lead to errors and consumes valuable time. Automating the process through facial recognition enhances accuracy and efficiency.

**Existing Solutions:** While there are existing attendance management systems, integrating facial recognition technology provides an additional layer of security and convenience.

## Project Scope

Our project includes the following components:

- **Front End:** User interface for attendance tracking, user management, and system configuration.
- **Back End:** Core logic and functionality for facial recognition, attendance processing, and interaction with the database.
- **Database Communication:** Storing and retrieving user and attendance data securely.
- **Dockerization:** Containerizing the application for easy deployment in various environments.
- **Testing with Flask:** Ensuring the Flask backend is robust through testing.

## Ideal Outcome

At the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following:

- Develop an intuitive and user-friendly application for attendance tracking using facial recognition.
- Provide a secure and efficient solution to automate attendance processes.
- Utilize Docker for seamless deployment in different environments.
- Ensure code quality and reliability through Flask testing.
